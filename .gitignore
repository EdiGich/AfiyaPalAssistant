# Data and RAG Components (CRITICAL for this project)
# ===============================================

# 1. RAG Vector Store (ChromaDB)
# DO NOT commit your indexed data, it can be huge and is built locally.
chroma_db/
.chroma/

# 2. Local RAG Model Downloads (HuggingFace/LlamaIndex)
# These are the files downloaded for the local BGE embedding model.
# Typically stored in the user's home directory or a cache folder.
.cache/
llama_index_cache/
.llama_index/
sentence_transformers/

# 3. Local Data (Your PDFs)
# While the PDFs themselves are source material, the /data folder 
# should generally be ignored if the files are large or managed separately.
# NOTE: If you want to commit the small manual PDFs, remove the line below.
# For this RAG project, it's often best to keep the PDFs in the repo 
# so others can easily rebuild the index. I will comment this out.

# 4. Agent Development Kit (ADK)
# ADK often generates run files and logs.
